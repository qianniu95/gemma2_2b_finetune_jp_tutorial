# Fine-Tuning Google Gemma for Japanese Instructions

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Google Gemma 2 2B model to improve its performance on Japanese instruction-following tasks. It utilizes the Hugging Face ecosystem, including `transformers`, `datasets`, and `trl` libraries, to efficiently fine-tune the model using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) technique.

## Features

- Fine-tuning Google Gemma 2 2B model for Japanese language tasks
- Utilization of QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning
- Dataset preparation and formatting for instruction tuning
- Integration with Hugging Face's `transformers` and `trl` libraries
- Model evaluation and inference examples

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Datasets
- TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)
- Accelerate
- PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
- BitsAndBytes

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:

   - The notebook uses the "Mustain/JapaneseQADataset" from Hugging Face, but you can replace it with your own dataset.
   - Ensure your dataset is in the correct format (conversation or instruction format).
2. Set up your environment:

   - Make sure you have access to a GPU for faster training.
   - Set your Hugging Face token for accessing the Gemma model.
3. Run the notebook:

   - Follow the steps in the notebook to load the model, prepare the dataset, and start the fine-tuning process.
4. Evaluate the model:

   - Use the provided evaluation code to test your fine-tuned model on new Japanese instructions.

## Key Components

- **Model**: Google Gemma 2 2B
- **Fine-tuning Method**: QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Training Framework**: TRL's SFTTrainer
- **Dataset**: Japanese Q&A dataset (customizable)

## Results

The notebook demonstrates how the fine-tuned model improves in following Japanese instructions compared to the base model. Specific results may vary based on your dataset and training parameters.

## Customization

You can easily adapt this notebook for other languages or specific domains by:

- Changing the base model (e.g., to Gemma 2 9B or other models)
- Using a different dataset relevant to your task
- Adjusting hyperparameters in the `TrainingArguments` and `LoraConfig`
