        "# How to Fine-Tune LLMs in 2024 with TRL\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models or LLMs have seen a lot of progress in the last year. We went from now ChatGPT competitor to a whole zoo of LLMs, including Google's [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma), Meta AI's [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf), Mistrals [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) & [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) models, TII [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b), and many more.\n",
        "Those LLMs can be used for a variety of tasks, including chatbots, question answering, summarization without any additional training. However, if you want to customize a model for your application. You may need to fine-tune the model on your data to achieve higher quality results than prompting or saving cost by training smaller models more efficient model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook walks you thorugh how to fine-tune open LLMs using Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) in 2024. In the notebook, we are going to:\n",

        "## 1. Define our use case\n",
        "\n",
        "When fine-tuning LLMs, it is important you know your use case and the task you want to solve. This will help you to choose the right model or help you to create a dataset to fine-tune your model. If you haven't defined your use case yet. You might want to go back to the drawing board.\n",
        "I want to mention that not all use cases require fine-tuning and it is always recommended to evaluate and try out already fine-tuned models or API-based models before fine-tuning your own model.\n",
